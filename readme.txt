Build a native mobile app of your WordPress blog. Fast, easy and free.

== Description ==

**Transform your blog into a Native App**

Worona is an open source WordPress plugin that enables users to convert their WordPress Blog into a native mobile App. Worona is divided into 2 different parts: the WordPress plugin itself, which prepares the content of your WordPress site to be sent to the app, and the native app coded using Corona SDK.

The functioning of Worona is pretty easy. In this first release, Worona plugin takes all the posts from your site, and presents them into an app. All this process is fully covered in our <a href="https://www.worona.org/start/" target="_blank">installation guide</a>. We have tried to make it as visual and simple as possible, but weâ€™d love to hear your ideas to improve it!


**See an example**

If you want to see how this looks like just check our demo App:

* **Android**: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.worona.android.worona_blog" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.worona.android.worona_blog</a>
* **iOS**: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/worona-blog/id918477223" target="_blank">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/worona-blog/id918477223</a>

There you have our <a href="https://www.worona.org/blog" target="_blank">blog</a> converted into a native App.


**Device Support (Smartphones &Tablets)**

Our App works in iOS and Android, it also looks great in phones and tablets. We have tested it in: iOS 7 (iPhone and iPad), iOS 8 (iPhone and iPad), Android 4.0, Android 4.1 and Android 4.4.

If you detect any problem with other devices o platforms, please drop us a line at <a href="mailto:hello@worona.org">hello@worona.org</a>

**Roadmap**

For the moment we only support "posts", but we know that "custom content" and "pages" are really important for you. Our plan is to support them before we launch the 1.0 version.

Our plans:

* Navigation menu.
* Support pages.
* Support custom content.
* Easy customization (adding more styles).

If you need any of these features before we finish them, write us. We will guide you through the process of adapting the App to your needs.

**Push notifications and other extensions**

We are developping a set of <a href="https://www.worona.org/extensions" target="_blank">Extensions</a> to give extra powers to your App.

* <a href="https://www.worona.org/extension-push-notifications/" target="_blank">Push Notifications</a>
* <a href="https://www.worona.org/extension-rate-my-app/" target="_blank">Rate my App</a>

We believe that Worona will be used as a standard to easily create native apps straight from WordPress. And you are very welcome to join us in this adventure :)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it free? Where is the trick? =

There is no trick. Worona is free and open source. It will always be. We sell additional services like <a href="http://www.worona.org/hosting">quality hosting</a>, <a href="http://www.worona.org/publish">uploading your app</a> to the App Store and Google Play or <a href="http://www.worona.org/extensions">premium extensions</a>, but you can always host it in other servers, upload it to the stores yourself and create your own plugins or use the free ones we or other people provide.

= Do I have to compile the app myself? =

If you want to upload your app to the app markets yourself, you have to compile it yourself, but it's an easy task which doesn't need any coding knowledge. You just have to follow some simple steps and we provide you with a comprehensive guide to do so.
If you want us to <a href="http://www.worona.org/publish">upload your app</a> to the App Store and Google Play for you, we will take care of all the process, so you don't have to worry about compiling :).
