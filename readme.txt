Build a native mobile app of your WordPress blog. Fast, easy and free.

== Description ==

**Transform your blog into a Native App**

Worona is an open source WordPress plugin that enables users to convert their WordPress Blog into a native mobile App. Worona is divided into 2 different parts: the WordPress plugin itself, which prepares the content of your WordPress site to be sent to the app, and the native app coded using Corona SDK.

The functioning of Worona is pretty easy. In this first release, Worona plugin takes all the posts from your site, and presents them into an app. All this process is fully covered in our <a href="https://www.worona.org/start/" target="_blank">installation guide</a>. We have tried to make it as visual and simple as possible, but we’d love to hear your ideas to improve it!


**See an example**

If you want to see how this looks like just check our demo App:

* **Android**: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.worona.android.worona_blog" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.worona.android.worona_blog</a>
* **iOS**: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/worona-blog/id918477223" target="_blank">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/worona-blog/id918477223</a>

There you have our <a href="https://www.worona.org/blog" target="_blank">blog</a> converted into a native App.

through the process of adapting the App to your needs.

**Push notifications and other extensions**

We are developing a set of <a href="https://www.worona.org/extensions" target="_blank">Extensions</a> to give extra powers to your App.

* <a href="https://www.worona.org/extension-push-notifications/" target="_blank">Push Notifications</a>
* <a href="https://www.worona.org/extension-rate-my-app/" target="_blank">Rate my App</a>
* <a href="https://www.worona.org/extension-enhanced-list/" target="_blank">Enhanced List</a>


**Device Support (Smartphones &Tablets)**

Our App works in iOS and Android, it also looks great in phones and tablets. We have tested it in: iOS 7 (iPhone and iPad), iOS 8 (iPhone and iPad), Android 4.0, Android 4.1 and Android 4.4.

If you detect any problem with other devices o platforms, please drop us a line at <a href="mailto:hello@worona.org">hello@worona.org</a>

**Roadmap**

For the moment we only support "posts", but we know that "custom content" and "pages" are really important for you. Our plan is to support them before we launch the 1.0 version.

Our plans:

* Categories in the menu.
* Support pages.
* Support custom content.
* Easy customisation (adding more styles).

If you need any of these features before we finish them, write us. We will guide you 

We believe that Worona will be used as a standard to easily create native apps straight from WordPress. And you are very welcome to join us in this adventure :)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it free? Where is the trick? =

There is no trick. Worona is free and open source. It will always be. We sell additional services like <a href="http://www.worona.org/publish">uploading your app</a> to the App Store and Google Play or <a href="http://www.worona.org/extensions">premium extensions</a>, but you can always upload it to the stores yourself and create your own plugins or use the free ones we or other people provide.

= Do I have to compile the app myself? =

If you want to upload your app to the app markets yourself, you have to compile it yourself, but it's an easy task which doesn't need any coding knowledge. You just have to follow some simple steps and we provide you with a comprehensive guide to do so. 
If you want us to <a href="http://www.worona.org/publish">upload your app</a> to the App Store and Google Play for you, we will take care of all the process, so you don't have to worry about compiling :)

= Can I extend Worona App features? =

Of course you can, we encourage users to modify Worona's code to change the appearance or even to add new features. We also sell different extensions in our marketplace (<a href="https://www.worona.org/extensions">Worona Extensions</a>), with them you can add extra features without coding.

If you're looking for a new feature, please let us know, maybe it's in our roadmap or we can program it for you.

= Do I have to pay a monthly fee? =

No, there are no monthly fees. Worona is free, unlike other plugins Worona runs directly in your WordPress site, with no platforms in the middle. That's why you don't have to pay for using the plugin.

= Do I have to create the iOS and the Android App? =

You don't have to. You can choose the platforms you want to cover with your App. There is no difference using our technology.

= Can I publish an App without paying the Developer Accounts to Apple and Google? =

For the moment, the only way to publish an App to the Apple App Store or the Google Play is having a Developer Account. This is why even when Worona is free, you will have to spend some money in order to have you App published.

= Why do I need a Mobile App instead of a Responsive theme? =

We think you don't have to choose between both solutions. With a Mobile App your users can read the content even when they don't have internet connection, they can receive <a href="https://www.worona.org/extension-push-notifications/">push notifications</a> every time new posts are available and you can drive more engagement on your blog content.

For example, sites like Amazon, Youtube, Soundcloud have both: a Mobile App and a Responsive web.
